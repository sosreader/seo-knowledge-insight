With the [robots.txt file](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro), site owners
have a simple way to control which parts of a website are
accessible by crawlers.
To help site owners further express how search engines and web
crawlers can use their pages, the community involved in developing web standards
[came
up with robots `meta` tags in 1996](https://www.w3.org/Search/9605-Indexing-Workshop/ReportOutcomes/Spidering.txt),
just a few months after `meta` tags were proposed for HTML (and anecdotally,
also before Google
was founded). Later,
[`X-Robots-Tag`
HTTP response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Robots-Tag) were added.
These instructions are sent together with a URL, so crawlers can only take them into account
if they're not disallowed from crawling the URL through the robots.txt file. Together, they
form the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP).

## A look at robots `meta` tags

[Meta
tags (or elements)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) are a way to include machine-readable metadata.
Robots `meta` tags are one "kind" of `meta` tag, and apply to crawlers, including search engine
crawlers. They signal: Is the content blocked from indexing? Should links on the page not be followed for
crawling? It's easy to give this information on the page directly with robots `meta` tags.

## A Robots Exclusion Protocol for any URL

To give the same level of control to non-HTML content, the "`X-Robots-Tag`" HTTP response header
was created. These
[HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)
are considered a part of the REP as well.
The header supports the same values as the robots `meta` tag,
and can be added to any piece of content served online.
Besides HTML, Google supports it for content like PDFs, document files, and even images.
Most of these file formats don't have a mechanism equivalent to `meta` tags, so a HTTP
response header is helpful.

## Getting started with robots `meta` tags and headers

The syntax is simple and extensible. The rules are generally either implemented by the web
developer or through a Content Management System (CMS), where site-owners may have checkboxes
or drop-down menus to select their preferences.
These controls can address a specific crawler, such as Googlebot or, by omitting a specific name,
address all crawlers that support these values.

For example, the following rules tell all crawlers not to use the associated page for indexing:

* In form of an HTML `meta` tag, on a web page:

  ```
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex">
  ```

  Looking at existing `meta` tags or response headers is a bit more involved,
  and requires direct examination of page content or headers.
  You can view HTML
  `meta` tags on any page either looking at the page source in your browser, or using Chrome's
  developer tools to
  [inspect
  the page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements).
* In form of an [HTTP
  response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header):

  ```
  X-Robots-Tag: noindex
  ```

  You can check the HTTP response headers for individual URLs with Chrome's developer tools, in the
  [network panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/overview).

Other examples of what you can do:

| Don't show a snippet for this page or document. | In HTTP header:    ``` X-Robots-Tag: nosnippet ```  or in HTML:    ``` <meta name="robots" content="nosnippet"> ``` |
| Don't index this page in `ExampleBot-News`, without specifying a preference for others.  These controls explicitly specify one crawler. | ``` X-Robots-Tag: examplebot-news: noindex ```  or    ``` <meta name="examplebot-news" content="noindex"> ``` |
| `ExampleBot` should not show a snippet, and additionally, all crawlers should not follow the links on this page.  Note that the most restrictive, valid directives apply, so for `ExampleBot` the directive would be combined as "`nosnippet, nofollow`". | ``` X-Robots-Tag: examplebot: nosnippet X-Robots-Tag: nofollow ```  or    ``` <meta name="examplebot" content="nosnippet"> <meta name="robots" content="nofollow"> ``` |

## Choosing a REP mechanism

How do you choose which one to use? Fundamentally robots.txt and page-level controls are similar,
but not completely interchangeable.
Sometimes there's a specific action that's only possible
with one of the mechanisms, for example,
if it's desired to stop the act of crawling (such as
for endless search results pages, possible with robots.txt),
if you need a control for an FTP server (possible with robots.txt),
or if it's desired not to have a snippet shown for a page (which is only possible with page-level
elements).
If you don't need to differentiate between blocking crawling and blocking indexing,
one approach is to use robots.txt for broader controls (to block large parts of a website),
and page-level controls for blocking individual pages.

## Robots Exclusion Protocol—a powerful, living standard

All of these controls are extensible by nature. Over the years, site-owners, crawler operators,
and search engines have worked together to evolve them.
Historically it started with a handful
of values, including `noindex` and `nofollow`, then later on more values like
`nosnippet`, `noarchive`,
and `max-snippet:` were adopted.
And sometimes values are deprecated, as was the case with `noodp`,
which used snippets from
[DMOZ / Open Directory Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMOZ)
before the directory was closed.
There's a
[plethora of values](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag#directives) supported
by Google for site owners, and a similar amount from other large crawler operators.

Under the REP umbrella, site owners have control over what is crawled and how the crawled data
is used in search engines.
They can do this on a broad level for bigger parts of websites,
or at a very granular level, for individual pages, even for images within pages.
These controls are well-known, available in all common content management systems,
broadly supported by commercial operators, and used on
billions of hosts on the internet today.
