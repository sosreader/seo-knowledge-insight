A long-standing tool for website owners, robots.txt has been in active use for over 30 years and
is broadly supported by crawler operators (such as tools for site owners, services, and search
engines). In this edition of the [robots refresher series](/search/blog/2025/02/intro-robots-refresher),
we'll take a closer look at robots.txt as a flexible way to tell robots what you want them to do
(or not do) on your website.

## Getting started with robots.txt

The way these files work is simple: you make a text file called "robots.txt" and then upload it to
your website—and if you're using a content management system (CMS), it's likely even easier. You
can leave your robots.txt file empty (or not have one at all) if your whole
site may be crawled, or you can add rules to manage crawling. For example, to tell all bots (also
known as crawlers, robots, spiders) to stay out of your "add to cart" page, you could write this
in your robots.txt file:

```
user-agent: *
disallow: /cart
```

## More specific things you can do with robots.txt

robots.txt is the Swiss Army knife of expressing what you want different robots to do or
not do on your website: it can be just a few lines, or it can be complex with more elaborate
rules targeting very specific URL patterns. You can use a robots.txt file for solving technical
issues (such as [unnecessary paginated pages](/search/docs/specialty/ecommerce/pagination-and-incremental-page-loading#avoid-indexing-variations)),
or for editorial or personal reasons (such as just not wanting certain things crawled). For
example, you could:

| **Inform multiple bots (but not all) about the same rule**  This group tells both `examplebot` and `otherbot` to stay away from the `/search` path. | ``` user-agent: examplebot user-agent: otherbot disallow: /search ``` |
| **Tell one bot to avoid paths that contain a specific piece of text**  For example, you could tell `documentsbot` not to crawl any file that contains ".pdf" in its name. | ``` user-agent: documentsbot disallow: *.pdf ``` |
| **Tell a bot it may crawl your blog, but not the drafts** | ``` user-agent: documentsbot allow: /blog/ disallow: /blog/drafts/ ``` |
| **Block a crawler from part of your website, while allowing other crawlers to access your site**  This robots.txt file disallows the mentioned `aicorp-trainer-bot` from accessing anything other than the home page, while allowing other crawlers (such as search engines) to access the site. | ``` user-agent: * allow: /  user-agent: aicorp-trainer-bot disallow: / allow: /$ ``` |
| **Leave a comment for your future self**  You can start a line with `#` to remind yourself about why you put a certain rule there. | ``` # I don't want bots in my highschool photos user-agent: * disallow: /photos/highschool/ ``` |

## Making changes to your robots.txt file (practically)

The [Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9309/) works
by putting together rules ("allow" or "disallow")
and specifying which robots these rules apply to. You don't need to learn programming or fiddle
with tools; you can just put these rules in a text file and upload it to your website.

For most websites, it's even simpler than that! If you're using a CMS, it usually has
something already built in to help you change your robots.txt file. For example, some CMSes let
you customize your robots.txt file using checkboxes or with a simple form, and many have plugins
that help you set up and write rules for your robots.txt file. To check what's possible within
your CMS, you can do a search for the name of your CMS +"edit robots.txt file".

Once you've got things set up, you can also test to make sure your file is set up how you
intended. There are many testing tools built by the web community to help with this, such as
[TametheBot's robots.txt testing tool](https://tamethebots.com/tools/robotstxt-checker)
and this [robots.txt parser](https://www.realrobotstxt.com/) that
are using the [open-source robots.txt parser library](https://github.com/google/robotstxt).
